## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Nowadays, people have a higher and higher pursuit of quality of food and drink. Especially, more and more people have a personal and special preference for diet choices. Facing a large number of restaurants, there is a strong potential demand to recommend them to the customers accurately and efficiently, which could help customers to enjoy the diets and avoid wasting on what they do not like.

When the customers select a recommended restaurant, they continue to order what is very probably delicious for them. In the meantime, food balanced nutrition is also getting more and more attention. Therefore, our system will recommend reasonable and healthy food based on customers' information, such as gender, fitness times and personal objectives.

With obesity on the rise, many people are trying to eat healthily or meet personal weight goals. Therefore, food recommendation has great potential. By collecting user information, selecting and recommending well-matched nutritious diets based on user characteristics, it can help dieters who want to control their daily energy intake to plan their diets very well. It saves users time, learning costs and improves the efficiency of their diet planning.

Our system focuses on 2 parts of the customers eating. Firstly, recommend the restaurants for the customers based on their rating records, which aims to provide the restaurants most likely to satisfy them and meeting their diet preference. Besides, 

Our Good Meal aims to provide a better and healthier eating experience by quickly and accurately planning next meal for users.
GoodMeal uses the personal health information entered by users to set different nutritional goals, change the recommended rules, and select a variety of food categories from the database to recommend to users. 

For example, users of different ages have different requirements for each nutrient, and their energy and protein requirements can vary significantly depending on their personal exercise habits. In addition, for people who want to lose fat and weight, the intake of carbohydrates and fats will be significantly reduced. After the completion of the formulation of nutrition goals, it is necessary to set the rules of screening, using the food nutrition composition in the database as constraints, after planning, o get the combination of specific food, and to show to users.
